# Salary Prediction and Analysis BI Dashbaord with Open AI Integration
## Description
In this project, I developed a salary analysis dashboard using data from the Stack Overflow Developer Survey and the OpenAI GPT turbo model. To ensure accurate and reliable analysis, I applied data preprocessing techniques to clean and transform the survey data. By leveraging various data visualization techniques, I created visually appealing charts and graphs that effectively conveyed salary insights. Working closely with my team, we collaborated on the design and optimization of the salary analysis dashboard, enabling us to provide actionable insights to stakeholders. This project aimed to empower decision-makers with a comprehensive understanding of salary trends and patterns within the developer community.
